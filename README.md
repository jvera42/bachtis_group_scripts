# bachtis_group_scripts
A collection of some Python scripts I created for working within the CMS group under Dr. Michalis Bachtis at UCLA.

# kraken_plots.py
This script was for parsing through a text file for an extended monitoring test of the Kraken PCB. The text file contained readouts of various parameters for certain components within the board at different timeslices. The script reads through the file, separates and reoraganizes the data into multiple time-series arrays for each parameter for each component, and plots the data according to the desired parameters.
